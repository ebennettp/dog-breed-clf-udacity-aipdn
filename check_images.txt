Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed?
If not, report the differences in the classifications.

    Yes, dog label and breed were correctly classified


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that
model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

    The horizontally flipped and rotated representation of Dog_01 was correctly labeled by the
resnet and vgg models. However, alexnet's prediction resulted in a different dog breed


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs?
If not, report the misclassifications.

    The non-dog animal was wrongly detected as dog by alexnet and resnet, but classified successfully by vgg as a cat.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at
classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

    Based on the tested resulets I consider the vgg model to have the best classification performance.
It also was the only model with a perfect accuracy for the uploaded images.
